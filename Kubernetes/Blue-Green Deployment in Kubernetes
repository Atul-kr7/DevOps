⎈ Blue-Green Deployment in Kubernetes 🟦🟩
⇢ A Hands-On Example with Deployment and Service Manifests

In the fast-paced world of software development, deploying updates and new features while maintaining uptime and minimizing risks is crucial. Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy that helps achieve this by reducing downtime and risk during deployments. In this guide, we’ll explore what Blue-Green Deployment is, its benefits, how it works, and a practical example using Kubernetes. 

Benefits of Blue-Green Deployment:
⇢ 1. Zero Downtime: By having two identical environments, you can switch traffic seamlessly from one environment to another without any downtime.
⇢ 2. Risk Mitigation: Since the new version is deployed in an isolated environment, any issues can be identified and resolved before directing traffic to it. 
⇢ 3. Rollback Capability: If any issues arise after switching traffic to the green environment, you can quickly rollback by redirecting traffic back to the blue environment. 

In this blog, I've explored the powerful concept of Blue-Green Deployment strategy in Kubernetes, along with a practical example that demonstrates their usage.

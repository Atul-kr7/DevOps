Reverse Proxy vs. API Gateway vs. Load Balancer 
 
Modern websites and applications have complex architecture needs. Here we'll explore three key components: 
 
ðŸ”¹Reverse Proxy: Acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers. Key features include: 
- Returning data requests on behalf of backend servers 
- Shielding sensitive infrastructure from external probing 
 
ðŸ”¹API Gateway: Sits between clients and backend services, acting as a single entry point. It routes requests to the appropriate services. Useful for: 
- Organizing communication between frontends and intricate backends 
- Avoiding exposing all services publicly 
 
 ðŸ”¹Load Balancer: Distributes network traffic across multiple servers, preventing overload on any single resource. Crucial for: 
- Managing high traffic loads without downtime 
 
These represent powerful tools for building robust, secure, and scalable modern web stacks. They each serve distinct purposes, but frequently work together seamlessly.

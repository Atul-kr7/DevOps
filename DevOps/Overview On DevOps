Clients donâ€™t care about your Cloud/Kubernetes certificates.

They care about:

- Can you solve the business problem?
- Can you align with business impact?
- Can you deliver results on time?
- Can you uphold integrity?

An intense 2-month preparation can get you any of the certifications.

But the qualities that clients care about are hard to build.

It takes constant Observation, Adaptation, and Execution.

Stop getting obsessed with the certifications.

Start focusing on business impact.

Certifications are very good skill validators, but...

You get paid for your solutions, not the certifications.

In my ~17 years of career, I am yet to see a client asking for my certifications. 

Brutal Fact.

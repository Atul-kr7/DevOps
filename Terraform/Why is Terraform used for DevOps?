Why is Terraform used for DevOps?

Terraform uses a JSON-like configuration language called the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). 
HCL has a very simple syntax that makes it easy for DevOps teams to define and enforce infrastructure configurations across multiple clouds and on-premises data centers.
